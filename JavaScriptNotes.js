// Programming Basics in JavaScript - Notes

// two forward slashes represent a comment

/*

This is another type of comment which goes
over multiple lines

It is considered good practice to put comments into your code
*/

/* JavaScript is written in C-Style syntax
A JavaScript program is made up of a series of statements and each statement ends with a new line or semicolon (;)

example of two statements (one on each line):

a = "Hello World!";
alert(a);

A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly brackets:

{
	// this is a block containing two statements
	var a = "Hello World";
	alert(a);
}

Blocks do not need to be terminated by a semicolon
Whitespace can be used as much as you like - indenting code for example and nesting code

/* JavaScript has six different types of values - There are five primitive data types

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean (True / False)
4. undefined
5. null

Any value that isn't one of the primitive data types listed is an object(6.)

*/

/* JavaScript has an Operator called "typeof" which finds out the type of a value - examples:

typeof "hello"
"string"

typeof 10
"number"

typeof true
"boolean"

typeof { ninja: "turtle"}
"object"

*/

/* Operators - An Operator applies an operation to a value, which is known as the operand.  There are three different operands:

1. unary operator - only requires one operand
typeof "hello" - the operator is typeof and the string "hello" is the operand
2. binary operator - requires two operands
3 + 5 - the operator is the + sign  The numbers 3 and 5 are the operands
3. ternary operator - requires three operands

*/

/* Strings - A String is a collection of letters or characters.  We can create a string literal by writing a group of characters
inside quotation marks, either single or double:

"hello"
'hello'

String Constructor Function

You can create a string object using the following constructor function:

new String("hello")

This will create a new string that is the same as the string literal "hello", although it will be classed as an object rather
than a primitive value.

For this reason it is preferable to use the string literal notation - requires less typing.

If you want to use quotes inside a string, you can use the opposite of either double or single depending on which you use:

"Darren said 'hello'"
'Darren said "hello"'

Otherwise you need to escape the character by using a backslash:

\' - escape single
\" - escape double
\n - end of line
\r - carriage return
\t - tab
\\ - escaping an actual backslash requires 2x

*/

/* Variables - Variables are a way of storing a value in memory for later use.  In JavaScript you declare a variable by using the keyword var

You don't have to declare a variable before you use it but bad things can happen if you don't.  Best practice to always declare a variable.

You can declare multiple variables at once seperating with a comma: 

var a,b,c;
